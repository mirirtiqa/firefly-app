Semester Project Part 2 - Application of a natural algoritm

The problem chosen : Constrained Continuous Optimisation problem

This problem was chosen to solve using Firefly Algorithm.

A multimodal cubic function was chosen as an objective function. The objective function in this implementation can be set to any other function as well.

This function can be changed. The firefly algorithm has parameters: alpha value, beta, gamma, delta and these values can be tuned.

The programming language used is Python.

The implementation can be found in notebooks/fire-fly-app.ipynb
