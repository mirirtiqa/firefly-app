Semester Project Part 2 - Application of a Natural Algorithm ie Firefly Algorithm

The problem chosen : Continuous Optimisation problem


In this repo, two cases were tackled: 
1. a multimodal cubic function was chosen as an objective function. 
2. optimisation of the design of the structural beam

The target is to minimise the objective function in both cases and get the value of the variables at the global minima.

The objective function in these implementations can be set to any other function with minimum changes to the rest of the code while applying to other use cases.

The firefly algorithm has parameters: alpha value, beta, gamma, delta and all these values can be tuned in this implementation.

The programming language used is Python.

The implementation can be found in notebooks/fire-fly-app.ipynb for case 1 and fire-fly-app-2.ipynb for case 2.
