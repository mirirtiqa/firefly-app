Semester Project Part 2 - Application of a Natural Algorithm ie Firefly Algorithm

The problem chosen : Continuous Optimisation problem

This problem was chosen to solve using Firefly Algorithm.

In this example, a multimodal cubic function was chosen as an objective function. 

The target is to minimise this function and get the value of the variables at the global minima.

The objective function in this implementation can be set to any other function while applying it to other use cases.

The firefly algorithm has parameters: alpha value, beta, gamma, delta and all these values can be tuned in this implementation.

The programming language used is Python.

The implementation can be found in notebooks/fire-fly-app.ipynb
