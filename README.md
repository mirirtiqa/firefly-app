Semester Project  - Use a Natural Algorithm to solve a real-world problem

One of the most common real-world problem is get the global minima or maxima of any function.
This problem was chosen to solve using a firefly algorithm

A dummy function was chosen as an objective function.

This function can be changed. The firefly algorithm has parameters: alpha value, beta, gamma, delta and these values can be tuned.

The programming language used is Python.
